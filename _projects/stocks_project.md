<strong>Project overview:</strong>
- Designed, developed, and tested an ML (RNN/LSTM) model for predicting key financial metrics (e.g. EBITDA), <strong>achieving 70% accuracy on real market data</strong>; used technologies such as pandas, NumPy, and PyTorch.
- Used pandas and Beautiful Soup to build an end-to-end data pipeline that automatically parses 8-K SEC filings and standardizes/extracts information which <strong>provided new data from over 1,000 publicly traded companies</strong>.
