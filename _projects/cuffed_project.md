<strong>Project overview:</strong>
- Trained and evaluated several <strong>multimodal deep learning models</strong> to predict if a user is likely to swipe left/right on another user for improved deck creation using Python, NumPy, pandas, and PyTorch.
- <strong>Increased prediction accuracy by 64% and precision by 167%</strong>, when compared to naive approaches.
- Built off of Gale-Shapley algorithm for optimal matching and deployed the model for deck generation using Python,
TensorFlow, and AWS SageMaker.
