<strong>Note:</strong> This is an overview of the paper "Norm Propagation in Online Communities:
Structural, Temporal, and Community Analysis" by [Raed Alharbi](https://www.raedalharbi.com/#/About%20me), <strong>Youval Kashuv</strong>, and [My T. Thai](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mythai/) (currently under review). The paper can be found here.

Remember when your social media feed suddenly became a battleground of mask debates and vaccine discussions? The COVID-19 pandemic didn't just change our daily lives; it transformed our online world too. As we scrolled through endless posts about social distancing and hand washing, a fascinating phenomenon was unfolding right before our eyes: the rapid spread of social norms in the digital age.

But here's the thing - not all norms are created equal. Some encourage us to protect ourselves and others, while some... well, let's just say they're not exactly based on solid science. So, how exactly do these different types of norms spread through our interconnected online communities? In the following discussion, we will dive deep into this digital petri dish. We will shed light on this complex process, and in the process reveal fascinating differences between the spread of positive and negative norms. 

<h4>A Tale of Two Norms</h4>
First things first, let's break down what we mean by "norms." In this context, we're talking about two main flavors:
- <strong>Positive descriptive norms:</strong> Think mask-wearing (maybe?), social distancing, and sharing accurate health information. The kind of stuff that makes your grandmother proud.
- <strong>Negative descriptive norms:</strong> This is where things get a bit wild - conspiracy theories, misinformation, and all those strange ideas your uncle shares at family gatherings.

Here are some examples of tweets reflective of positive and negative descriptive norms:
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% twitter https://x.com/CDCgov/status/1272551942741360641 %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% twitter https://x.com/NiallSnipars/status/1276534503448641539 %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Examples tweets propogating public health guidelines (left) and conspiracy theories (right). Observe how the tweet on the right recieved much more attention in the form of likes than its counterpart. This is quite common as we will see. Put simply, misinformation makes money.

For the remainder of this post, I will refer to positive and negative descriptive norms simply as "norms". Descriptive norms are only one subclass of social norms, if you desire a more comprehensive overview I recommend reading [this](https://chatgpt.com/) and [that](https://chatgpt.com/). We analyzed millions of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines, looking at how these different norms spread and evolved over time. What we found was eye-opening.

<h4>The Life and Times of a Social Norm</h4>
Imagine you're watching a race between a tortoise and a hare. Except in this case, the tortoise is wearing a mask and the hare has got some interesting ideas about 5G towers.

<strong>Positive noms,</strong> our trusty tortoise, tend to have a longer lifespan They start slow, gradually picking up steam as more people get on board. Think about how mask-wearing became more common over time. These norms show a steady increase in engagement, followed by a slow, graceful decline. They're in it for the long haul.

<strong>Negative norms,</strong> on the other hand, are like that hare - they burst out of the gate at lightning speed but run out of steam just as quickly. They spread like wildfire initially, but their engagement drops off sharply soon after.

<h4>The Need for Speed (and Consistency)</h4>
When it comes to how fast these norms spread, our hare (negative norms) still has the edge - at least initially. They propagate quickly, often fueled by sensationalism. But remember, slow and steady wins the race. Positive norms show a more consistent and slower spread of information over time. 

This difference in speed has big implications for how we tackle misinformation. When a new conspiracy theory pops up, time is of the essence. Fact-checkers and health communicators need to be quick on their feet to counter false information before it spreads too far.

<h4>Community Structure & Influencers</h4>
Now, let's zoom out and look at the bigger picture - the structure of these online communities.

Communities sharing positive norms tend to be more centralized. Think of them like a solar system, with authoritative sources (like health professionals or government agencies) at the center, and other users orbiting around them. These central figures often act as the main distributors of information. Here, influencers often act as bridges, connect the authoritative sources at the center with the broader audience on the outskirts.

On the flip side, communities spreading negative norms are more like a web. They're less centralized, with influence more evenly distributed among members. It's a "strength in numbers" kind of situation, where the sheer volume of voices can sometimes drown out more authoritative sources. Influencers in these communities tend to connect strongly with other influencers, creating what are called echo chambers. It's like a game of telephone, but instead of the message getting garbled, it just gets louder and more convincing with each retelling.

<h4>Why is this information useful?</h4>
Understanding these dynamics isn't just a matter of esoteric erudition - it has real-world implications for how we approach public health communication and fight misinformation. 
1. <strong>Playing the long game:</strong> When it comes to promoting positive behaviors, consistency is key. Public health campaigns need to be prepared for a marathon, not a sprint. The gradual rise and fall of engagement with positive norms suggest that patience and persistence pay off.
2. <strong>Fact checking:</strong> Countering negative norms requires quick reflexes. Given their rapid initial spread, it's crucial to get accurate information out there fast.
3. <strong>Influencer strategy:</strong> For positive norms, the goal should be to help influential figures reach broader audiences. When it comes to combating negative norms, the focus might be on breaking up those echo chambers.

<h4>Looking Forward</h4>
As we continue to face global challenges that require coordinated behavior changes, understanding these online dynamics becomes increasingly important. It's not just about COVID-19 - these insights could be applied to all sorts of public health and social issues.

For policymakers, health officials, and social media platforms, this research offers a roadmap for more effective communication strategies. By recognizing the unique characteristics of how positive and negative norms spread, we can design more targeted and efficient approaches to promoting beneficial behaviors and countering harmful misinformation.

In an age where a tweet can sometimes seem more powerful than a doctor's advice, this kind of research is crucial. It helps us understand not just the digital landscape, but also how to navigate it more effectively. The goal? Fostering healthier online communities and, ultimately, a better-informed society.

So the next time you're scrolling through your feed and come across yet another post about the latest health trend or conspiracy theory, take a moment to think about the journey that information has taken to reach you. And maybe, just maybe, think twice before hitting that share button.
